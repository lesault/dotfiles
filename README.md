# .dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for Ubuntu running in WSL2 on Windows 11
- Use at your own risk!

1. Install stow
2. Clone this repository into ~/.dotfiles
3. cd .dotfiles
4. run stow <folder name> to make a symbolic link from ~
   e.g. ```stow bash```
   will create:
   ```~\.bashrc -> .dotfiles/bash/.bashrc```
