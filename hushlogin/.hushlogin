# The .hushlogin file suppresses unnecessary login messages
# for a cleaner login experience. It removes the display
# of the "Last login" message and other system information
# that might otherwise clutter the terminal when logging in.
# This file helps streamline the login process while
# maintaining the functionality of the shell.
